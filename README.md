🌸 Iris Flora: Advanced Classification Web ApplicationA full-stack data science project demonstrating a complete machine learning pipeline, from model training to interactive web deployment. This project classifies Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements using a highly accurate Random Forest model, visualized via a professional Streamlit interface.🔗 Live Demo: iris-classifier-advanced.streamlit.app🔗 Portfolio: youssefmejri.com✨ FeaturesAspectDescriptionKey Technologies🤖 ModelRobust Random Forest Classifier trained on the classic Iris dataset.scikit-learn, joblib🏗️ ArchitectureClean separation of concerns: train.py for model generation and app.py for deployment.Python🎛️ InterfaceInteractive web application allowing users to input parameters via sliders.Streamlit📊 VisualizationElite, interactive data visualization for deep analysis.Plotly Express, Graph Objects🧠 AnalysisIncludes a 3D Scatter Plot of the dataset and a dynamic Radar Chart comparing inputs to species averages.Data Visualization🚀 Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.1. PrerequisitesEnsure you have Python 3.7+ installed.2. Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/YoussefMejriCs/iris-classification-advanced.git](https://github.com/YoussefMejriCs/iris-classification-advanced.git)
cd iris-classification-advanced
3. Install DependenciesInstall all required Python packages using the provided requirements file.pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Train the ModelExecute the training script to generate the serialized model file (iris_model.pkl).python train.py
5. Run the Streamlit AppLaunch the web application. This will open the app in your default browser.streamlit run app.py
🖼️ Application OverviewInteractive Prediction InterfaceUsers can adjust the four key biological features (sepal length/width, petal length/width) using sliders. The model instantly outputs the predicted species along with confidence scores.High-Class VisualizationThe application provides two advanced views for data insight:3D Scatter Plot: Visualizes the entire dataset distribution in 3D space and highlights the user's input point relative to the natural clusters.Radar Chart: Compares the user's input features against the average feature values of the predicted species, providing immediate dimensional analysis.🤝 ContributionFeel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues.Developed by Youssef Mejri
